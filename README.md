A simple website to generate a image with prompts templates.

Based on [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) and [wibus-wee/stable_diffusion_chilloutmix_ipynb](https://github.com/wibus-wee/stable_diffusion_chilloutmix_ipynb)

## Features

Here are some features of this app:

- Remote Prompts Library
- Use RESTFul API to generate a image
- Native dark mode
- Support LoRA Network

There are some features that are not yet implemented:

- [ ] Support "Addtional Network"
- [ ] Customizable prompts templates
- [ ] Choose custom checkpoints
- [ ] Download the generated image

## Usage

If you are using [wibus-wee/stable_diffusion_chilloutmix_ipynb](https://github.com/wibus-wee/stable_diffusion_chilloutmix_ipynb), you should turn the `apiSupport` to `true` in step 3 ( in "Startup Options" section ).

Or you can add `--api --cors-allow-origins "*" --listen` to the command line, and then you can use this website to generate a image with prompts templates.

## About using LoRA

Because there is no way to generate a image with "Addtional Network", so in this app, we will add `<lora:lora_name:lora_weight>` to the end of the prompt to replace the "Addtional Network".

However, using lora in "Addtional Network" seems to be a little different from using lora in prompt in the final generated image, i'm trying to fix this.
